## 🛠️ **How to Access the Whiteboard**

### **Method 1: Standard Screen Sharing**
1. Start regular session at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click screen share button
3. Use any drawing app (MS Paint, Miro, etc.)
4. Say "Start whiteboard exercise"

### **Method 2: Built-in Whiteboard** ⭐
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/whiteboard`
2. Click "Share Whiteboard" 
3. Use the built-in drawing tools
4. Get guided instructions from the agent

## 🎯 **Interactive Whiteboard Exercises**

### 🔥 **Network Security Design**
```
Say: "Start network exercise"

Agent will guide you:
Step 1: Draw Internet cloud
Step 2: Add firewall (brick wall)
Step 3: Create DMZ with web server
Step 4: Add internal firewall
Step 5: Place database securely

Agent will see and correct your design!
```

### 🔐 **Encryption Flow Visualization**
```
Say: "Start encryption exercise"

Learn to draw:
- Plain text transformation
- Algorithm processing boxes
- Key injection points
- Cipher text output
- Decryption reverse flow
```

### 🤝 **Protocol Handshake Diagrams**
```
Say: "Draw TCP handshake"

Create timing diagrams:
- Client/Server columns
- SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK arrows
- Connection established
- Security implications
```

### 🌳 **Attack Tree Analysis**
```
Say: "Start attack tree exercise"

Map security threats:
- Root cause at top
- Branch to attack vectors
- Sub-branches for techniques
- Mitigation strategies
```

## 🚀 **Sample Learning Session**

### **Step 1: Start the Exercise**
```
You: "Start network exercise"

Agent: "Great! Let's design a secure network. 
First, draw the Internet cloud at the top of your whiteboard..."
```

### **Step 2: Draw While Being Guided**
```
Agent: "Perfect! Now add a firewall between the Internet and your network.
Draw it as a brick wall to show it's blocking unauthorized traffic..."

You: (Draw firewall)

Agent: "Excellent! I can see your firewall. 
Now let's create a DMZ section for your web server..."
```

### **Step 3: Get Real-time Feedback**
```
Agent: "Great network design! I notice you placed the database in the internal network,
which is perfect for security. Consider adding an IDS sensor to monitor traffic..."
```
