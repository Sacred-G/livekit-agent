But let's be real, no prevention
is ever perfect. So, what happens if an
attacker gets past that first line?
Well, that's where detective controls
come in. Their job isn't to stop the
incident, but to identify it and sound
the alarm, letting you know that
something is wrong. And you can see the
exact same pattern for detection. A
technical control like system logs
creates the evidence trail. The
managerial control is the process of
actually reviewing those logs to spot
weird anomalies. An operational control
is a guard actively patrolling the
grounds. And a physical control is a
motion detector that trips an alarm.
They don't stop the attack, but and this
is critical, they tell you it's
happening.


So, an alarm goes off, an
incident has been detected. Now what?
You have to fix it, and you have to fix
it fast. That is the job of corrective
controls. These are the actions you take
after an incident to limit the damage
and get back to business. This slide
shows that response in action. Just
imagine ransomware hits one of your
servers. The detection system sends an
alert. That's step one. Then the
corrective control kicks in. Your team
activates its incident response plan.
Maybe that means isolating the system
and restoring everything from a clean
backup. The whole point is to have a
swift and orderly recovery.


Now, to round out our framework,
let's quickly hit the final three actions. Deterrent
controls are all about a bit of
psychological warfare. Think of a sign
that says, "This area is under video
surveillance." It might not physically
stop someone, but it sure makes them
think twice. Compensating controls are
your crucial plan B. When a primary
control fails, let's say the power goes
out. Your backup generator kicks in,
it's a vital safety net. And finally,
directive controls are there to guide
behavior. That authorized personnel-only
sign is a simple command telling people
where they should and more importantly
shouldn't go.


Now it is so important to
remember that this matrix isn't some
rigid set in stone rulebook. It's a
mental model. It's a really powerful way
to organize your thinking about security
and to make sure you've got all your
bases covered.


So, if there's one key
takeaway, it's this. Security is not a
one-size-fits-all checklist. It just
isn't. The controls a hospital needs to
protect patient data are going to be
vastly different from what a small
retail shop needs. This framework gives
you the power to analyze your own
specific risks and build a fortress that
is just right for you.


So, I'll leave
you with this question to chew on. Now
that you have this complete framework in
your head, which type of security
control do you think is the most
overlooked out there in the real world?
Something to think about. Thanks for
